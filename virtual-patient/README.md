## Welcome to Virtual Patient xapi profile

The Virtual Patient Profile describes health professions education verbs, activities and learner performance with the goal of defining activities generally provided by a Virtual Patient application.

While there is a broader scope for the term 'Virtual Patient', for this profile, we are referring specifically to Interactive Patient Scenarios: multimedia patient case designed to teach clinical reasoning skills such as diagnostic test ordering and interpretation.

In particular, this work arose from the Medbiquitous xAPI Working Group and from the ANSI/Medbiquitous Virtual Patient Standard.
